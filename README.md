<p>This is a simple React application that displays stock information for a few corporations. The purpose of the website is to use react-router-dom to navigate through different pages. The stock data is hard coded in a JavaScript file, so no external APIs or databases are required.</p>

<h2>How to Run</h2>
<p>To run the app, simply clone the repository and navigate to the project directory in your terminal. Then, run the following commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>npm install</li>
<li>npm start</li>
</ul>
<p>This will install any necessary dependencies and start the development server. The app will open in your default browser at http://localhost:3000/.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Once the app is running, you'll see a table displaying stock information for a few different corporations. You can sort the table by clicking on the column headers, or search for specific stocks using the search bar at the top of the page.</p>

<p>The app is designed to be simple and easy to use, with no unnecessary features or distractions. It's perfect for quickly checking stock prices and trends for a few different companies.</p>

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>
<p>In the future, I want to updating the app to fetch stock data from an external API, rather than hard coding it in a JavaScript file. This would allow the app to display up-to-date stock information in real time, without the need for manual updates.</p>

<p>Additionally, I want to consider adding more features to the app, such as the ability to track specific stocks or receive alerts when stocks reach certain prices.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, this React application provides a simple and effective way to display stock information for a few different corporations. With its straightforward design and easy-to-use interface, it's the perfect tool for keeping an eye on the stock market.</p>
